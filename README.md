<!--- I recently downloaded the MOPAC2016TM program (updated version Sept. 2023) for calculating and plotting the electrostatic potential maps. However, due to the following error I am not able proceed further. Kindly advice:
Eoor: The MOPAC job generated unexpected output messages:
       MOPAC Job: "BENZENED_B.mop" ended normally on Dec 22, 2023, at 10:36.
The cause of this problem may be explained in the last few lines of MOPAC's .out file.
Please view the following, and check its contents, especially at the end of the file:
C:\Users\rg.gonnade\Desktop\miscellanous\MOPAC\BENZENED_B.out
